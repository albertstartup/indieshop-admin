# Why
We will build an open source e-commerce platform built with speed and saftey as top priorities. There are a lot of possible innovations in the e-commerce space which current offerings makes hard to implement.

# How
We will use the latest technologies that allow us both to move fast and have safe code. We will start with the Javascript ecosystem and transition to safer more powerful languages such as Clojure. To start we will use Next.js for speed and TypeScript for saftey.

# Principles
## Documentation Driven Development
We will make great documentation a priority so that future developers will not spend to much time trying to reverse engineer the system.
